# Fashion MNIST Classifier

Notebook that contains my exploration in creating a model that can classify
images in the Fashion MNIST dataset.

## Models

There are two setups in this repository. The first one,
[fashion-mnist-classifier-simple.ipynb](fashion-mnist-classifier-simple.ipynb),
is a simple artifical neural network that has a 88% accuracy on the test set.
The second one,
[fashion-mnist-classifier-cnn.ipynb](fashion-mnist-classifier-cnn.ipynb), is a
convolutional neural network that has a 91% accuracy on the test set.
